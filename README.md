### My background üë©‚Äçüíª
I've worked in the digital marketing sector for 5 years now, with a specialism in social media and email design. I've also created and actively manage websites via WordPress and Shopify. Alongside my freelance work, I am an Executive Assistant at a UK-based charity.

### Front-End Web Development üñ•Ô∏è
Designing websites has always been my favourite part of my freelance work, and so this is why I decided to enroll on the University of Birmingham's Front-End Web Development bootcamp course. 

I'm learning a lot, but it's early days... so watch this space!
